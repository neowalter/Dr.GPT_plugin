Step 1: Use the search_web tool to query the arxiv.org website for the latest papers related to quantitative trading. For example, the query could be site:arxiv.org quantitative trading. This will return a JSON string with the web search results, including the titles, snippets, and URLs of the papers.
Step 2: Parse the JSON string and extract the relevant information from the web search results. For example, you could use a loop to iterate over the results and store the titles, snippets, and URLs in separate variables or lists.
Step 3: Use the summarize tool to generate a summary of each paper based on the snippet or the full text (if available). For example, you could use the summarize tool with the snippet or the URL as the input and the desired summary length as the parameter. This will return a string with the summary of the paper.
Step 4: Use the explain tool to generate an explanation of the quantitative trading models and strategies involved in each paper based on the summary or the full text (if available). For example, you could use the explain tool with the summary or the URL as the input and the desired explanation level as the parameter. This will return a string with the explanation of the paper.
Step 5: Format the output using markdown elements to present the information in a visually appealing manner. For example, you could use headings, tables, lists, code blocks, and hyperlinks to display the titles, summaries, explanations, pubilish date, and URLs of the papers. You could also use bolding to highlight the key points or terms in the papers.
