Could you assist me in coding a snippet that utilizes OpenAI's artificial intelligence model, GPT-4, to produce a list of relevant and helpful tips based on the user's stated interests? The OpenAI GPT-4 service is a natural language generation model that can produce text based on a range of prompts. The code snippet should accept a sentence from the user which describes their interests, and in return generate a useful list of tips to aid them in achieving their goals. For instance, if the user's input was 'I want to improve writing and researching' the output could outline various skills in writing and researching, with practical, scientific, and step-by-step approaches towards improving those skills.
